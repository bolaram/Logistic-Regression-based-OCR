# Logistic-Regression-based-OCR
 It's a machine learning classification problem. I've used data from sklearn datasets. First, I've load data , split it, checked if the splitting working or not. Then, train and predict the data. The accuracy of this model is 95%. This project is on Logistic Regression based Optical Character Recognition.
